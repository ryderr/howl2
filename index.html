		For Carl Solomon
		I

		I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by 
		madness, starving hysterical naked, 
		dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn 
		looking for an angry fix, 
		angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly 
		connection to the starry dynamo in the machin- 
		ery of night, 
		who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat 
		up smoking in the supernatural darkness of 
		cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities 
		contemplating jazz, 
		who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and 
		saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tene- 
		ment roofs illuminated, 
		who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes 
		hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy 
		among the scholars of war, 
		who were expelled from the academies for crazy &amp; 
		publishing obscene odes on the windows of the 
		skull, 
		who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burn- 
		ing their money in wastebaskets and listening 
		to the Terror through the wall, 
		who got busted in their pubic beards returning through 
		Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York, 
		who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in 
		Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their 
		torsos night after night 
		with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares, al- 
		cohol and cock and endless balls, 
		incomparable blind; streets of shuddering cloud and 
		lightning in the mind leaping toward poles of 
		Canada &amp; Paterson, illuminating all the mo- 
		tionless world of Time between, 
		Peyote solidities of halls, backyard green tree cemetery 
		dawns, wine drunkenness over the rooftops, 
		storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon 
		blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree 
		vibrations in the roaring winter dusks of Brook- 
		lyn, ashcan rantings and kind king light of mind, 
		who chained themselves to subways for the endless 
		ride from Battery to holy Bronx on benzedrine 
		until the noise of wheels and children brought 
		them down shuddering mouth-wracked and 
		battered bleak of brain all drained of brilliance 
		in the drear light of Zoo, 
		who sank all night in submarine light of Bickford's 
		floated out and sat through the stale beer after 
		noon in desolate Fugazzi's, listening to the crack 
		of doom on the hydrogen jukebox, 
		who talked continuously seventy hours from park to 
		pad to bar to Bellevue to museum to the Brook- 
		lyn Bridge, 
		lost battalion of platonic conversationalists jumping 
		down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills 
		off Empire State out of the moon, 
		yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts 
		and memories and anecdotes and eyeball kicks 
		and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars, 
		whole intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days 
		and nights with brilliant eyes, meat for the 
		Synagogue cast on the pavement, 
		who vanished into nowhere Zen New Jersey leaving a 
		trail of ambiguous picture postcards of Atlantic 
		City Hall, 
		suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grind- 
		ings and migraines of China under junk-with- 
		drawal in Newark's bleak furnished room, 
		who wandered around and around at midnight in the 
		railroad yard wondering where to go, and went, 
		leaving no broken hearts, 
		who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing 
		through snow toward lonesome farms in grand- 
		father night, 
		who studied Plotinus Poe St. John of the Cross telep- 
		athy and bop kabbalah because the cosmos in- 
		stinctively vibrated at their feet in Kansas, 
		who loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking vis- 
		ionary indian angels who were visionary indian 
		angels, 
		who thought they were only mad when Baltimore 
		gleamed in supernatural ecstasy, 
		who jumped in limousines with the Chinaman of Okla- 
		homa on the impulse of winter midnight street 
		light smalltown rain, 
		who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston 
		seeking jazz or sex or soup, and followed the 
		brilliant Spaniard to converse about America 
		and Eternity, a hopeless task, and so took ship 
		to Africa, 
		who disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving 
		behind nothing but the shadow of dungarees 
		and the lava and ash of poetry scattered in fire 
		place Chicago, 
		who reappeared on the West Coast investigating the 
		F.B.I. in beards and shorts with big pacifist 
		eyes sexy in their dark skin passing out incom- 
		prehensible leaflets, 
		who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting 
		the narcotic tobacco haze of Capitalism, 
		who distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union 
		Square weeping and undressing while the sirens 
		of Los Alamos wailed them down, and wailed 
		down Wall, and the Staten Island ferry also 
		wailed, 
		who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked 
		and trembling before the machinery of other 
		skeletons, 
		who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight 
		in policecars for committing no crime but their 
		own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication, 
		who howled on their knees in the subway and were 
		dragged off the roof waving genitals and manu- 
		scripts, 
		who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly 
		motorcyclists, and screamed with joy, 
		who blew and were blown by those human seraphim, 
		the sailors, caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean 
		love, 
		who balled in the morning in the evenings in rose 
		gardens and the grass of public parks and 
		cemeteries scattering their semen freely to 
		whomever come who may, 
		who hiccuped endlessly trying to giggle but wound up 
		with a sob behind a partition in a Turkish Bath 
		when the blond &amp; naked angel came to pierce 
		them with a sword, 
		who lost their loveboys to the three old shrews of fate 
		the one eyed shrew of the heterosexual dollar 
		the one eyed shrew that winks out of the womb 
		and the one eyed shrew that does nothing but 
		sit on her ass and snip the intellectual golden 
		threads of the craftsman's loom, 
		who copulated ecstatic and insatiate with a bottle of 
		beer a sweetheart a package of cigarettes a can- 
		dle and fell off the bed, and continued along 
		the floor and down the hall and ended fainting 
		on the wall with a vision of ultimate cunt and 
		come eluding the last gyzym of consciousness, 
		who sweetened the snatches of a million girls trembling 
		in the sunset, and were red eyed in the morning 
		but prepared to sweeten the snatch of the sun 
		rise, flashing buttocks under barns and naked 
		in the lake, 
		who went out whoring through Colorado in myriad 
		stolen night-cars, N.C., secret hero of these 
		poems, cocksman and Adonis of Denver-joy 
		to the memory of his innumerable lays of girls 
		in empty lots &amp; diner backyards, moviehouses' 
		rickety rows, on mountaintops in caves or with 
		gaunt waitresses in familiar roadside lonely pet- 
		ticoat upliftings &amp; especially secret gas-station 
		solipsisms of johns, &amp; hometown alleys too, 
		who faded out in vast sordid movies, were shifted in 
		dreams, woke on a sudden Manhattan, and 
		picked themselves up out of basements hung 
		over with heartless Tokay and horrors of Third 
		Avenue iron dreams &amp; stumbled to unemploy- 
		ment offices, 
		who walked all night with their shoes full of blood on 
		the snowbank docks waiting for a door in the 
		East River to open to a room full of steamheat 
		and opium, 
		who created great suicidal dramas on the apartment 
		cliff-banks of the Hudson under the wartime 
		blue floodlight of the moon &amp; their heads shall 
		be crowned with laurel in oblivion, 
		who ate the lamb stew of the imagination or digested 
		the crab at the muddy bottom of the rivers of 
		Bowery, 
		who wept at the romance of the streets with their 
		pushcarts full of onions and bad music, 
		who sat in boxes breathing in the darkness under the 
		bridge, and rose up to build harpsichords in 
		their lofts, 
		who coughed on the sixth floor of Harlem crowned 
		with flame under the tubercular sky surrounded 
		by orange crates of theology, 
		who scribbled all night rocking and rolling over lofty 
		incantations which in the yellow morning were 
		stanzas of gibberish, 
		who cooked rotten animals lung heart feet tail borsht 
		&amp; tortillas dreaming of the pure vegetable 
		kingdom, 
		who plunged themselves under meat trucks looking for 
		an egg, 
		who threw their watches off the roof to cast their ballot 
		for Eternity outside of Time, &amp; alarm clocks 
		fell on their heads every day for the next decade, 
		who cut their wrists three times successively unsuccess- 
		fully, gave up and were forced to open antique 
		stores where they thought they were growing 
		old and cried, 
		who were burned alive in their innocent flannel suits 
		on Madison Avenue amid blasts of leaden verse 
		&amp; the tanked-up clatter of the iron regiments 
		of fashion &amp; the nitroglycerine shrieks of the 
		fairies of advertising &amp; the mustard gas of sinis- 
		ter intelligent editors, or were run down by the 
		drunken taxicabs of Absolute Reality, 
		who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge this actually hap- 
		pened and walked away unknown and forgotten 
		into the ghostly daze of Chinatown soup alley 
		ways &amp; firetrucks, not even one free beer, 
		who sang out of their windows in despair, fell out of 
		the subway window, jumped in the filthy Pas- 
		saic, leaped on negroes, cried all over the street, 
		danced on broken wineglasses barefoot smashed 
		phonograph records of nostalgic European 
		1930s German jazz finished the whiskey and 
		threw up groaning into the bloody toilet, moans 
		in their ears and the blast of colossal steam 
		whistles, 
		who barreled down the highways of the past journeying 
		to each other's hotrod-Golgotha jail-solitude 
		watch or Birmingham jazz incarnation, 
		who drove crosscountry seventytwo hours to find out 
		if I had a vision or you had a vision or he had 
		a vision to find out Eternity, 
		who journeyed to Denver, who died in Denver, who 
		came back to Denver &amp; waited in vain, who 
		watched over Denver &amp; brooded &amp; loned in 
		Denver and finally went away to find out the 
		Time, &amp; now Denver is lonesome for her heroes, 
		who fell on their knees in hopeless cathedrals praying 
		for each other's salvation and light and breasts, 
		until the soul illuminated its hair for a second, 
		who crashed through their minds in jail waiting for 
		impossible criminals with golden heads and the 
		charm of reality in their hearts who sang sweet 
		blues to Alcatraz, 
		who retired to Mexico to cultivate a habit, or Rocky 
		Mount to tender Buddha or Tangiers to boys 
		or Southern Pacific to the black locomotive or 
		Harvard to Narcissus to Woodlawn to the 
		daisychain or grave, 
		who demanded sanity trials accusing the radio of hyp 
		notism &amp; were left with their insanity &amp; their 
		hands &amp; a hung jury, 
		who threw potato salad at CCNY lecturers on Dadaism 
		and subsequently presented themselves on the 
		granite steps of the madhouse with shaven heads 
		and harlequin speech of suicide, demanding in- 
		stantaneous lobotomy, 
		and who were given instead the concrete void of insulin 
		Metrazol electricity hydrotherapy psycho- 
		therapy occupational therapy pingpong &amp; 
		amnesia, 
		who in humorless protest overturned only one symbolic 
		pingpong table, resting briefly in catatonia, 
		returning years later truly bald except for a wig of 
		blood, and tears and fingers, to the visible mad 
		man doom of the wards of the madtowns of the 
		East, 
		Pilgrim State's Rockland's and Greystone's foetid 
		halls, bickering with the echoes of the soul, rock- 
		ing and rolling in the midnight solitude-bench 
		dolmen-realms of love, dream of life a night- 
		mare, bodies turned to stone as heavy as the 
		moon, 
		with mother finally ******, and the last fantastic book 
		flung out of the tenement window, and the last 
		door closed at 4. A.M. and the last telephone 
		slammed at the wall in reply and the last fur- 
		nished room emptied down to the last piece of 
		mental furniture, a yellow paper rose twisted 
		on a wire hanger in the closet, and even that 
		imaginary, nothing but a hopeful little bit of 
		hallucination 
		ah, Carl, while you are not safe I am not safe, and 
		now you're really in the total animal soup of 
		time 
		and who therefore ran through the icy streets obsessed 
		with a sudden flash of the alchemy of the use 
		of the ellipse the catalog the meter &amp; the vibrat- 
		ing plane, 
		who dreamt and made incarnate gaps in Time &amp; Space 
		through images juxtaposed, and trapped the 
		archangel of the soul between 2 visual images 
		and joined the elemental verbs and set the noun 
		and dash of consciousness together jumping 
		with sensation of Pater Omnipotens Aeterna 
		Deus 
		to recreate the syntax and measure of poor human 
		prose and stand before you speechless and intel- 
		ligent and shaking with shame, rejected yet con- 
		fessing out the soul to conform to the rhythm 
		of thought in his naked and endless head, 
		the madman bum and angel beat in Time, unknown, 
		yet putting down here what might be left to say 
		in time come after death, 
		and rose reincarnate in the ghostly clothes of jazz in 
		the goldhorn shadow of the band and blew the 
		suffering of America's naked mind for love into 
		an eli eli lamma lamma sabacthani saxophone 
		cry that shivered the cities down to the last radio 
		with the absolute heart of the poem of life butchered 
		out of their own bodies good to eat a thousand 
		years.

		Cory Arcangel style of the soul between 2 visual images 
		and joined the elemental verbs and set the noun 
		and dash of consciousness together jumping 
		with sensation in AOL Instant Messen- 
		ger 
		to recreate the syntax and measure of poor Google 
		searches and stand before YouTube speechless and intel- 
		ligent and shaking with shame, rejected yet con-

		of thought in his naked and endless head, 
		the Corey Worthington bum and Crank Dat beat in Time, unknown, 
		yet putting down here what might be left to say 
		in time come after death, 
		and rose reincarnate in the ghostly clothes of Melissa Smith in 
		the P. Diddy shadow of Making The Band 3 and blew the 
		suffering of America's naked mind for love into

		cry that shivered the blogs down to their last Rapidshare upload
		with the absolute heart of the tweet of life butchered 
		out of their own bodies good to read a thousand more

		our bedsheets the Internet that blogs all 
		night and won't let us sleep 
		I'm with you on the Internet 
		where we wake up electrified out of the coma 
		by our own souls' computer fans roaring over the 
		roof it's come to drop angelic bombs the 
		hospital illuminates itself imaginary walls col- 
		lapse O skinny legions run outside O starry 
		spangled shock of mercy the eternal war is

		I'm with you on the Internet 
		in my dreams you walk dripping from a sea- 
		journey on the information super highway across the Atlantic in tears
